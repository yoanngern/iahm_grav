Hello.
Do you remember that when you came to Romania you went to the backside of the room(where my father was sitting) and said "God heals anemia" I was at home with my mom, who had that problem, but she was healed!! A few days after you left, she took a bloodcheck and she was healed!
I'm glad that there still are people who are devoted to God and willing to do serve Him. God bless you!
